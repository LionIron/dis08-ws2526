## 3. Augment the Dataset

### my other open dataset on the web:

[The other dataset](https://offenedaten-koeln.de/dataset/vornamen-2023)

## How the two datasets could be linked or compared.

Both of these datasets contain information about the frequency of certain first names in different cities.
The time periods are different, but you can still compare how often a name was given to a child and whether there is a difference across the years.

## What kinds of research questions could be answered by combining them.

This comparison investigates whether the popularity of first names differs between smaller cities, such as Olpe, and larger urban areas like Cologne.
## What kinds of next steps would be necessary to merge the datasets?

Evaluating the most common names, analyzing their distribution by location, and identifying gender patterns.

## 4. Review the Dataset Using FAIR Principles
  ### Findable: Is the dataset easy to locate with sufficient metadata?
  It took me only one web-search to get to the datasets.
  ### Accessible: Can anyone download it without barriers?
  Both datasets are DL-DE->Zero-2.0 licenced so free to use and to download.
  ### Interoperable: Is it provided in a machine-readable, standard format?
  Both the datasets come in a CSV format.
  ### Reusable: Is the license clear, and is the documentation sufficient for reuse?
  Both websites clearly display the license information below the download button. <br>
  The accompanying documentation is well-structured and provides a clear understanding of the overall context and purpose of the datasets.
